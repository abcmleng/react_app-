# Code Flow and Notes - IDMerit Risk Analyzer

## App Structure Overview
- [x] Main App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
  - Two-panel layout: 30% left (Risk Display), 70% right (User Interaction)
  - State management for verification type, risk data, login status
  - Conditional rendering based on user selections

## Verification Flow
- [x] Initial Screen (`src/components/VerificationCards.tsx`)
  - Header with IDAssure logo and navigation
  - Two buttons: Bank Verification and Government Verification
  - Footer with copyright
- [x] Bank Verification (`src/components/BankVerification.tsx`)
  - Login form with email and password fields
  - On submit: calls `handleBankLogin` → evaluates risk via `evaluateEmailRisk`
  - Success: shows dashboard with TransactionForm and RecentTransactions
  - Uses BankHeader and BankFooter components
- [x] Government Verification (`src/components/GovernmentVerification.tsx`)
  - Form with full name, email, phone number
  - On submit: calls `handleGovernmentSubmit` → evaluates risk via `evaluateNameRisk`
  - Result: success/failure screen based on risk level
  - Uses GovernmentHeader and GovernmentFooter components

## Risk Evaluation Logic
- [x] Bank Risk (`src/utils/riskEvaluation.ts`)
  - `evaluateEmailRisk`: searches riskDataset for matching email
  - Returns RiskData or null
- [x] Government Risk (`src/utils/riskEvaluation.ts`)
  - `evaluateNameRisk`: checks if name contains "sumit" (high risk) else low risk
- [x] Sample Data (`src/data/riskData.ts`)
  - Three mock profiles: abhishek123@gmail.com (low), sumit123@gmail.com (high), romit1234@gmail.com (low)

## Risk Display Components
- [x] RiskDisplay (`src/components/RiskDisplay.tsx`)
  - Loading state: spinner during evaluation
  - Waiting state: prompt to select verification
  - Data state: RiskGauge, DeviceInfo, RiskSummary (gov only)
- [x] RiskGauge: visual risk score representation
- [x] DeviceInfo: device-related risk factors
- [x] RiskSummary: detailed risk breakdown for government

## Data Types and Interfaces
- [x] RiskData interface (`src/types/index.ts`)
  - idmDevice: incognito, VPN, bot detection
  - idmTrust: overall risk score, email/IP/contact details
  - idmSocialPhone/Email: social verification data
  - idmAml: anti-money laundering status
- [x] VerificationType: 'bank' | 'government' | null
- [x] BankLoginData: email, password
- [x] GovernmentFormData: fullName, email, phoneNumber

## Key Notes
- [x] Mock Implementation: uses setTimeout for API simulation (1.5s bank, 2s gov)
- [x] Privacy Fix: transactions filtered by userEmail to prevent data leakage
- [x] UI Themes: separate headers/footers for bank vs government
- [x] Risk Levels: binary (low/high) with green/red color coding
- [x] Tech Stack: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Lucide icons
- [x] Build Tool: Vite with PostCSS and ESLint
